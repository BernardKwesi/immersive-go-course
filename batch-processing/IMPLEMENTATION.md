## Plan

The planned architecture of this:

1. Read the CSV
2. Download the images to a location (`/tmp`)
3. Use imagemagick to monochrome them
4. Upload them to S3
5. Return the URL

I tried [an initial implementation](https://github.com/CodeYourFuture/immersive-go-course/pull/46) of this that went a long way, but that I didn't like in the end.

The first step will be to build this linearly, and to write tests as we go. Because there is real file getting and writing, we will run integration tests in Docker:

1. Mock the `jpg` get
2. Write a real file
3. Mock S3 methods using [s3iface](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sdk-for-go/api/service/s3/s3iface/)

Then use goroutines to run it in parallel, likely by wrapping the output in a mutex and locking/unlocking as the goroutine completes: https://pkg.go.dev/sync#Mutex

A possible last extension would be to use channels: https://go.dev/blog/pipelines

### Downloads

The download is simple â€” create a file in a temporary location, and `http.Get` into it with `io.Copy`.

### `imagemagick`

To run ImageMagick (and this whole thing) in a repeatable way, we will do it all in a Docker container based on `dpokidov/imagemagick:latest-bullseye` using multi-stage build. This will give us the `magick` command.

To be able to run the tests and the app, we end up with multiple targets:

```Dockerfile
FROM golang:1.19-bullseye as base

# ... install dependencies & build ...

FROM base as test

# ... run tests ...

FROM base as run

# ... run app ...
```

Which can then be built by specifying the `--target`:

```console
> docker build --target test -t test .
```

### Developing in Docker

To develop the app with Docker, we need a slightly fancier command:

```Makefile
develop:
    mkdir -p mount
    docker build --target develop -t develop .
    docker run -it --mount type=bind,source="$$(pwd)",target=/app --mount type=bind,source="/tmp",target=/tmp --rm develop
    rm -rf ./mount
```

## Grayscale

`convert`, accessed via `ConvertImageCommand`, with `-set colorspace Gray -separate -average` seems to work well.
